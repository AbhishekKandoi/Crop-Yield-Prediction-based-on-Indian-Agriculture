# Crop-Yield-Prediction-based-on-Indian-Agriculture

The main objective of this project is to predict crop-yield which can be extremely useful to farmers in planning for harvest and sale of grain. This project focuses on implementing a machine learning algorithm that gives better prediction of suitable crop for the corresponding region and crop season in our country using previously collected datasets. This project aims to predict yields based on location, crop type, temperature, humidity, and area of agricultural field data.
